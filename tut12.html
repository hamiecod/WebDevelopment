    <h3>HTML Semantic Elements</h3>
    <!--heading tags are also semantic tags, if its heading1 the engine lays more emphasis on it and ranks it when a particular URI is searched-->
    <!-- semantics mean to give a keyword to a particular area of a webpage so that the SEO knows what is what  -->
    <!-- it is not necessary but it makes our website rank good in SEO -->
    <!-- in early times, there were no semantics, all the things were defined with the class of the <div> tag -->
    <!-- for example: header, footer, article and navigation tags tell the browser that a particular area is a header which helps in ranking the website -->
    <!-- semantic tags give identity to the tags which help SEO check their level -->
