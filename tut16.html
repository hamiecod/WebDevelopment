    <!-- chrome developer tools are the tools which can manipulate a web page only in the particular user's view and the manipulation is not at all stored on the server -->
    <!-- these are opened by 'inspect' -->
    <!-- they can only be explained using chrome -->
    <!-- you know what they are -->
    <!-- you can make manipulation in a web page at your side  -->
    <!-- this is used either for a trial purpose to make changes in a website or to prank someone -->
    <!-- there are different tabs in the inspect from where we can change everything -->
    <!-- we can also visit the linked files -->
    <!-- the element tag is the main and is used for manipulation -->
    <!-- the sources page opens the linked files to the html document -->
    <!-- the network tab contains all the network requests which are the transaction between the server and the user -->
    <!-- the console tab is used to write some common Javascript -->
    <!-- the user agent stylesheet are the default css properties of chrome which maybe changed by the programmer -->

    <!-- do not use classes like 'bgYellow', instead use classes like 'bgPrimary' or 'bgSecondary' because it is a good practice -->
    <!-- it is a good practice because it is easier to identify them as they are used for multiple elements.... if the primary color of the webpage is red, it would be easy to identify that if i am using 'bgPrimary' that means it is the red color -->
